# Internet Radio

This is a very simple internet radio to play songs. This is my lesson plan for Interdisciplinary Coding (CSC-374). One of my Computer Science professors reach out and asked if I wanted to give a lesson and I was like why not and this is what I came up with. This is no where the most efficient path but it is a path that is possible. 

This project is meant for a linux based device like a raspberry pi. 

## Steps for Install

Make sure that python flask is installed on the device. 
```sh
sudo apt install python3-flask
```
